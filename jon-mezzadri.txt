Stretch Questions

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
	- positioning stays the same relative to parent, will stay where it is and other items ignore it - can throw the flow off of the rest of the elements! 
3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
	- using {display: inline;}
4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	- block by default: <div>, <address>, <header>
	- inline by default: <a>,<br>
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
	- Its a layout methodology that is all centered around the outside margin, then border, then padding, content in the center. I think of it like a box (border) containing tissue paper (padding) to protect a camera (content)
